# War Planner for YodasMarines on Star Wars Commander

Test war planning application for YodasMarines. Using Firebase, momentjs, highchartsjs, draggable points, material design lite. Goals are to resolve questions of 1) Timezones (war start time?), 2) Availability (who will be available when?), 3) Planning (when to coordinate a group push for outposts and attacks?).

 - Only sign-in through Google if you intend to add a new war.
 - No other authentication. Actual identities of players unknown (intentional).
 - Only your LINE name and timeline data points are saved, as a firebase JSON file.
 - As always, destroy the Empire!!!
